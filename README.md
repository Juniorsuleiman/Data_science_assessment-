# Using biopython to explore the olfactory response of the cabbage aphids to different volatile cues 

# In this experiment, different volatile cues were collected from cabbage plant which serves as a sustaible host plant for the cabbage aphids. These volatile cues ranged from plants without any infestation (HC = healthy cabbage), aphids infested cabbage plants (AC) as conspecific cues, diamondback moth larvae infested cabbage (DC) as heterospecific cues and a solvent control (CN). Aphids were exposed to the various odour cues in a four-choice laboratory olfactometer bioassay, and the time spent in each of the arms of the olfactomer was recorded (time spent = min). Using python, I demonstrate how the collected data could be explored, visualized, manipulated and also analyzed. This work is currently still in progress so data should be treated with caution.
